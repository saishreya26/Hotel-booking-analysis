# Hotel-booking-analysis
In the competitive hospitality industry, understanding and mitigating booking cancellations, reviews is crucial for optimizing revenue management, improving customer satisfaction, and enhancing operational efficiency. Hotel booking cancellations can lead to significant revenue losses and reduced occupancy rates. 
Therefore, an in-depth analysis of cancellation patterns and feedback is essential for developing effective strategies to minimize cancellations and improve the reviews.
The primary objective of this analysis is to identify and understand the key factors influencing hotel booking cancellations and reviews. 
By leveraging historical booking data, the analysis aims to provide actionable insights to reduce their occurrence of cancelling and negative feedback. 
Customer feedback is crucial to hotel operations. Customer reviews can be negative in terms management or maintenance.
Therefore, examining customer reviews will also provide insight into what needs to be improved. This will help in devising targeted strategies to enhance customer retention, optimize booking policies, and improve overall revenue management.
